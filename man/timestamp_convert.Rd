\usage{
timestamp_convert(studs, month1 = 3, week1 = 11, day1 = 83,
  days_in_weeks = FALSE, timestamp = "resp_time")
}
\arguments{
\item{studs}{A data.frame where each row corresponds to an
observation on a student, and at least one column contains
UNIX timestamps.}

\item{month1, week1, day1}{Integers specifying the
month, week and day of the year that the study begins.
Best left as defaults.}

\item{days_in_weeks}{Logical, only used if \code{timestamp}
is not default. If \code{TRUE} then days are per week and
factors rather than per year and integer.}

\item{timestamp}{Character string indicating which variable
contains unix time stamps to convert to columns date,
day, week and month. Leave as default for no conversion.}
}

Convert StudentLife UNIX timestamps to day, week and month
in study.
